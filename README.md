Question answering over Knowledge Base for Complex Questions - [KBQA.pdf](https://github.com/rishabhvaish/Machine-Learning/blob/master/KNN/KNN.pdf)

Although recent research work has seen improvement in answering simple questions, few researches have studied handling complex questions that require much more inference, common sense or multi-hop reasoning. Also, for question answering over knowledge base, one major assumption is that the knowledge base usually contains all the necessary information, which is not likely to happen in real world. Therefore, our project will delve into the question answering task over knowledge base on complex questions with multiple information sources. We use state-ofthe-art GraftNet model and conduct experiment on Complex WebQ dataset under three settings: (1) knowledge base only; (2) text only; and (3) combined sources of both text and knowledge base, and compare the performance with simple question datasets such as WebQuestionsSP and Wikimovies. We have seen far more significant decrease in the Hits@1 score of text only setting than other two settings. We also have observed that when questions are complex, adding text as another information source does not help improve machineâ€™s comprehension. We further test fact-dropout on Complex WebQ, and conclude that it can also function as regularization for complex questions.
